# Simple Go Blockchain with Networking

This project is a minimal blockchain implementation in Go, now enhanced with basic networking. It demonstrates the core concepts of blockchainsâ€”block creation, hashing, and chain validationâ€”while allowing multiple clients to connect and interact with the blockchain over TCP.

## Features

- **Block Structure:** Each block contains an index, timestamp, BPM (beats per minute, as example data), hash, and previous hash.
- **Hashing:** Blocks are linked using SHA-256 hashes.
- **Validation:** New blocks are validated before being added to the chain.
- **Networking:**  
  - Runs a TCP server (port configurable via `.env`).
  - Multiple clients can connect and submit new BPM values.
  - Blockchain state is periodically broadcast to all connected clients.
- **Chain Replacement:** The blockchain is replaced if a longer valid chain is received.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16+ installed
- [go-spew](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew)
- [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)

Install dependencies:
```sh
go get github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with:
   ```
   PORT=8080
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   go run networking.go
   ```

## Usage

### Connect as a Client

You can use `nc` (netcat) or `telnet` to connect to the blockchain server:

```sh
nc localhost 8080
```
or
```sh
telnet localhost 8080
```

- After connecting, you will be prompted to enter a BPM value.
- Enter an integer and press Enter to submit a new block.
- The blockchain will be periodically broadcast to your terminal in JSON format.

### Example Session

```
Enter a new BPM:72

Enter a new BPM:80

[...blockchain JSON output every 30 seconds...]
```

## How It Works

- The blockchain is a slice of `Block` structs.
- Each blockâ€™s hash is calculated from its contents and the previous blockâ€™s hash.
- The server starts with a genesis block.
- New blocks are added by clients submitting BPM values over TCP.
- The blockchain is periodically sent to all connected clients.

## Notes

- This is a demonstration and **not suitable for production**.
- There is no peer-to-peer networking or consensus algorithm.
- The blockchain is stored in memory and will reset on restart.
- All clients share the same blockchain state managed by the server.
